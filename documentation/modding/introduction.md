# Modding
"Mod" is a term that is short for modification. you'll hear usually mod/modding as a term in gaming, where you change the game to add features or patch bugs, most studios and games usually don't allow mods as in their guidelines, 
especially online games. but sometimes, modding can apply to products, websites and apps to do the same as what people who mod video games do, we'll use mod and modding for the documentation on how to mod our web port.

# How we do modding
so, usually, modding isn't easy as there is no built in API until mod loaders come, there are many mod loaders for games now. but for our game/web port
there will be no need for mod loaders, we store all the stuff in JSON. Buildings, races, leaders, technology, etc
