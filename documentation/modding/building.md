it's pretty easy to use JSON/JSON5 so we're going to give you a bit of a crash course into it.

## The Crash Course Of JSON (Javascript Object Notation)

### value types

JSON has different value types or

* strings

```json
"string": "hello world",
```

* numbers

```json
"string": 0,
```

* objects

```json
"object": {"Nested value": "hello"}
```

* arrays

```json
"array": [0,1,2,3,"..."]
```

### rules

usually for value and key pairs that aren't the last have to have a comma afterwards Therefore,

This isn't legal:

```json
"username": "developer001" "creation-date": "1-1-2000 9:00 AM CMT"
```

This is legal:

```json
"username": "developer001",
"creation-date": "1-1-2000 9:00 AM CMT"
```
